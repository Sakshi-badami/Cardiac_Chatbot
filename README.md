Cardiac chatbot is a conversational system which can be used in predicting heart diseases. The system behaves like a Cardiologist which asks consulting questions related to heart problems and tries to provide relavent solutions. This helps in saving a lot of time of the doctor as it gets the consultation before hand. The system also helps the patient to book appointment with Cardiologists depending on the situation.
Prediction of Heart Diseases is achieved using ML based Support Vector Machine Algorithm with heart dataset implemented in python. To create a localhost on your PC, ngrok is used which uses port 5000 of your PC & generates a public link for your PC which is required to communicate with Dialogflow Chatbot.
